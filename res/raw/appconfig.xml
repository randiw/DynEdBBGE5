				<viewscript>Kathy: Our guest today is Bob Harris. Next summer, you're going to Alaska with your family.

Bob: That's right. We're going to take the ferry from Seattle to Anchorage, Alaska. And then we're going to drive around Alaska for a week.

Kathy: Are you going to rent a car?

Bob: No, we're going to rent a motorhome.

Kathy: A motorhome?

Bob: Yes. Some people call them RV's --recreational vehicles.

Kathy: Why are you going to rent a motorhome? Isn't it expensive?

Bob: Not really. When you travel by car, you have to stay in motels. Motels are expensive. When you travel in a motorhome, you don't have to pay for motels. You can sleep in the motorhome. And the motorhome has a kitchen, so we can cook our own meals. We can save a lot of money, because we don't have to eat at restaurants.

Kathy: Sounds like a great idea for a vacation, Bob.</viewscript>

Jenny: Well, for example, this morning he drew a picture of a mouse.

Kathy: A mouse?

Jenny: Yes. He drew a big circle for the head. Then he drew two circles next to each other -- inside the big circle.

Kathy: Those were the eyes?

Jenny: That's right. Those were the eyes. Then he drew a small circle for the nose, under the eyes. Then he drew a mouth below the nose.

Kathy: And what about the ears?

Jenny: He drew a circle on each side of the head. Those were the ears.

Kathy: You can make a lot of pictures with circles, can't you?

Mike: Yes, I do. I think more people should ride bikes.

Kathy: Why?

Mike: For one thing, it would help the environment. Cars are the major cause of air pollution in San Francisco. If more people rode bikes, there would be fewer cars on the road. There would be less air pollution. And riding a bike is a great way to save money. It's very expensive to own and drive a car. And if you ride a bike, you don't have to pay for parking. And parking is very expensive in San Francisco.

Kathy: If you can find a parking space!

Ellen: Nice to see you again, Kathy.

Kathy: You're going to talk to us today about water pollution.

Ellen: Yes. Do you know the biggest cause of water pollution in the United States?

Kathy: Is it... factories?

Ellen: No, it isn't. It's farming.

Kathy: Farming?

Ellen: Yes. Farming is the biggest cause of water pollution in the United States.

Kathy: How does farming cause water pollution?

Ellen: Most farmers use pesticides to kill insects. If these pesticides get into our water, they can cause water pollution. Water pollution can cause health problems.

				<viewscript>Kathy: Our guest today is John Orwell. How long will you stay in San Francisco?

John: I'll probably stay there for about a week.

Kathy: And then what?

John: Then I'll fly back to England. I'll try to get a non-stop flight.

Kathy: That's a long flight, isn't it?

John: Yes. It takes ten hours to fly from San Francisco to London. If I leave on a Saturday afternoon, I'll arrive in London on Sunday morning.

Kathy: So I'm sure you'll be tired.

John: I'm sure I will. There's an eight-hour time difference between San Francisco and London.</viewscript>
